Proof of concept for audio DSP using streams.

Current example just opens an mp3 file via [node-lame](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-lame) and pipes it through a DSP Transform stream before outputing it via [node-speaker](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-speaker).

The goal of the project is to explore the capabilities and posibilities of creating a DSP application in JS using streams.
